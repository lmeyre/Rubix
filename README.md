# Rubix

![alt text](/Img/Rubix.png)

This is a project about solving a RubixCube.

The cube is solved using the `Thistlethwaite`'s algorithm.

In bonus, the whole project is made on unity to have a 3D visual of the cube, and to see it being solve and move in real time. 

This also makes it possible to mix  the cube manually (instead of using a button), and to solve it manually by using the L(Left), R(Right), U(Up), D(Down), F(Front), B(Back) keys.
